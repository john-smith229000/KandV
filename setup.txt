Discord Activity: Quick Launch ChecklistThis is the fast way to get your activity running for a testing session. It assumes you have already completed the one-time setup (installing dependencies, creating the .env file, etc.).How to Test Your Game (Live Development Mode)Use this method when you are actively writing code and want to see your changes live.You will need three separate PowerShell terminals.
Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server
Navigate to the server folder:
	cd C:\Users\vince\Desktop\K+V\server
Start the server:
	npm start
Leave this terminal running.


Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Client
Open a second terminal.
Navigate to the client folder:
	cd C:\Users\vince\Desktop\K+V\client
Start the client:
	npm run dev
Leave this terminal running.


Terminal 3: Start the Secure Tunnel
Open a third terminal.
Navigate to your main project folder:
	cd C:\Users\vince\Desktop\K+V
Start the tunnel, pointing it to your CLIENT's port (from Terminal 2, usually 5173):
	.\cloudflared.exe tunnel --url [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173)
Leave this terminal running.


Final Step: Update and Launch
Copy the new .trycloudflare.com URL from Terminal 3.
Update both the URL Mapping and OAuth2 Redirect in the Discord Developer Portal.
Save the changes and launch your activity in a server voice channel.
